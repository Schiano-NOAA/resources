## Developer Usability Checklist

The National Stock Assessment Program in NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and 
Technology is responsible to the development of a suite of tools (R packages, 
applications, and templates) to help users conduct and understand stock 
assessments. We have designed this checklist to help our developers and those 
who want additional advice and guidance to promote and increase usability of 
their tools at all stages of development.

The following checklist is intended to guide a developer before, during, and 
after development. We hope this will help developers move forward with promoting 
their products and increasing usability within and outside of the agency. For 
information on specific tool quality standards, please see the [FIT Tool Quality 
Standards Checklist](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/noaa%20fit/tool-quality-reviewer-checklists/). 

>[!Note]
> The order of the list is intentional and should serve as stepping stones to complete the next task.

- [ ] **Identify user base:** who is intended to use this tool and how broad of an audience does this apply to?
- [ ] **User friendly documentation:** make sure that the message of what this tool does is clear and straightforward; design associated manual or documents for users to reference when they have questions
      - [ ] Constant reminder of coverage on repo
- [ ] **Cross team usage and understanding:** start with presenting tool to close knit teams and tie in potential collaborations
      - What are you asking the reviewers to provide feedback on?
- [ ] **Outreach:**
    - [ ] *Internal promotion:* takes the form of presentations, workshops, and consistency of content - what are other ways to promote our tools beyond the typical forms?
    - [ ] *External promotion:* present and hold workshops to user base, send around promotional material or mention when able to in communication of the tool
    - [ ] *User feedback:* follow up with users after release to improve tool
- [ ] **Widespread user training:** teaching the user base how to use the tool
- [ ] Make changes to **optimize code:** make intentional effort to improve coding practices and organization to streamline both coding for development and user application
- [ ] **Maintenance plans**
